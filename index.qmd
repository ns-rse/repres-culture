## About Me

+ Current : Research Software Engineer
+ Past :
  + Genetics Statistician
  + Medical Statistician in Clinical Trials
  + Data Scientist at Telematics Startup

::: {.notes}
Thank you and hello to everyone.

Thought it might be useful to give a very brief overview of who I am and my background.

Currently I'm a Research Software Engineer in the Department of Computer Science which means I work with researchers
across the University to help improve the quality of their software in terms of maintainability, documentation,
reproducibility, accessibility and the general FAIR for Research Software principles.

I've no formal computer science training though and my path to this position has been winding though, starting of as a
statistician, first in Statitical Genetics trying to identify genes that contribute to human diseases then as a Medical
Statistician in Clinical Trials before a stint as a Data Scientist in a Telematics Startup company.

## Reproducibility

+ Scripts and Code for (statistical) analysis...
  + What data is used?
  + What cleaning of data is undertaken?
  + What statistical methods used.
  + How tables and figures are created.
+ Version Control code as it evolves.
  + See how code has developed/changed over time.
  + Test code as its written
  + Share openly on GitHub/GitLab etc.
  + Peer review
. . .

::: {.notes}
During my years as a Statistician I developed an interest in reproducible research and adopted literate programming
practices which made the statistical analyses I undertook reproducible. This involved

In time as I learnt more about this I started version controlling my scripts and code so that I and others could see how
the work had evolved and easily correct the inevitable errors that cropped up.

And this is an important point, no one is infallible, we _all_ make mistakes even when we try our hardest not to. I
don't consider myself an expert or even good programmer, but I can improve the quality of my work by adopting good
working practices, which in software development involves writing tests, using common style guides and rules when
writing code and when it comes to incorporating changes in the main code base undertaking peer review whereby my
collaborators look at the work I have done and are able to comment and feedback before changes are incorporated.

+ Rigour - my work is a higher standard.
+ Transparency - improves trust in my work.
+ Openness - this is my work, but it can be improved on.

Why is this important? Well by sharing my code openly and honestly and saying "_Here is my attempt at solving this
problem, what do you think? Can it be improved?_" I have to make it easier for others to review my code and in so doing
I write cleaner code that is of a higher standard. I make sure that the code is easy to read, well documented and runs
as expected by writing tests, helping reduce the scope for

The transparency of putting work out there in the open means that others can have increased trust that I am not trying
to deceive anyone with the work I claim to have undertaken. If I wrapped my work up in a black box that people couldn't
see inside why would I expect anyone to trust the results I claim to be making?

This honesty and openness is a good thing in research because we have to be able to trust each other. After all...

## Research is a Social Endeavour

Science and research has never been an individual pursuit, rather it is a social endeavour where people work together,
sharing their work with others and building on what has gone before.

The culture of openness and replication is fundamental if Science and Research in general is to be self-correcting.

The discipline of Research Software Engineering is realtively young, having emerged roughly ten years ago, but it grew
out of a recognition that many people undertook computing and software development as part of their research, after all
computers are ubiquotous these days, but not everyone received training in how to do so following good practices.

By having RSE groups within Universities who are able to share with researchers good working practices that make their
code FAIR and open sourced not only do the individual researchers benefit as these practices make it easier to
understand their own work undertaken in the past, others who will come after us will be able to understand and build on
what has been done with greater ease.
