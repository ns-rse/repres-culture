# Panel Discussion -

Dr Jenni Adams, Open Research Manager, University of Sheffield, has organised a day on [_Reproducible research and a
culture of honesty, rigour and
transparency_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tCexuUiaGawAxTqNHi02amcfKO-XzPJuC10EIwbhOik/edit) and invited me to
sit on the panel discussion.

The remit for the discussion is...

> For the session on  'Reproducible research and a culture of honesty, rigour and transparency', which we've
> provisionally scheduled for 11.15-12.00 on the day, we were wondering if you might be interested in participating in a
> panel discussion? This would involve giving a short (e.g. 5min) talk on your approach to the topic with reference to
> specific issues/practices/disciplinary concerns/barriers you'd like to explore, alongside talks from at least 2-3
> other panellists from a range of disciplines. These short talks will be followed by discussion among the panel members
> and audience. Our overall brief for the session is below.
>
> This session will explore the ways in which open methodologies are crucial to developing a research culture of
> honesty, transparency and rigour, and will examine how institutions, research groups and individuals can embed these
> practices in the pursuit of genuine cultural change. Weâ€™ll examine how the research community can normalise, reward
> and recognise the sharing of pre-registrations, data, code, and null results; and will explore the extent to which
> reproducible methods can be applied to a broad range of disciplines.
