This involved writing reports in LaTeX with tables and figures generated automatically from scripts.\nIn time as I learnt more about this I started version controlling my scripts and code so that I and others could see how the work had evolved and easily correct the inevitable errors that cropped up.\nAnd this is an important point, no one is infallible, we all make mistakes even when we try our hardest not to. I don’t consider myself an expert or even good programmer, but I can improve the quality of my work by adopting good working practices, which in software development involves writing tests, using common style guides and rules when writing code and when it comes to incorporating changes in the main code base undertaking peer review whereby my collaborators look at the work I have done and are able to comment and feedback before changes are incorporated.\nFurther by making the code I work on these days open to others they are able to scrutinise, critique and contribute to the work."

Well by sharing my code openly and honestly and saying “Here is my attempt at solving this problem, what do you think? Can it be improved?” I have to make it easier for others to review my code and in so doing I write cleaner code that is of a higher standard. I make sure that the code is easy to read, well documented and runs as expected by writing tests, helping reduce the scope for errors in the first instance as I’m more rigorous.\nThe transparency of putting work out there in the open means that others can have increased trust that I am not trying to deceive anyone with the work I claim to have undertaken. If I wrapped my work up in a black box that people couldn’t see inside why would I expect anyone to trust the results I claim to be making?\nThis honesty and openness is a good thing in research because we have to be able to trust each other.

    "text": "Research is a Social Endeavour\n\n\n\n“If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.” - Isaac Newton\n\n\n\n\n\nScience and research has never been an individual pursuit, rather it is a social endeavour where people work together, sharing their work with others and building on what has gone before.\nThe culture of openness and replication is fundamental if Science and Research in general is to be self-correcting.\nThe discipline I work in now, Research Software Engineering, is relatively young, having emerged roughly ten years ago, but it grew out of a recognition that many people undertook computing, statistical analysis and software development as part of their research, after all computers are ubiquotous these days, but not everyone received training in how to do so following good practices.\nAnd this is one practice that Universities can adopt to improve the quality and openness of software and analyses.\nResearch groups aren’t going to attract software engineers to work on short-term contracts but by having RSE groups within Universities who are able to share with researchers good working practices that make their code FAIR and open sourced not only do the individual researchers benefit as these practices make it easier to understand their own work undertaken in the past, others who will come after us will be able to understand and build on what has been done with greater ease."
